## why you need a virtual environment

To keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated
python virtual environments for them


## Step 0

It comes pre-installed with python 3


## Step 1
First create a project directory you want to install the virtual environment
** mkdir **

Or alternatively clone a repository from GitHub
** git clone **

## Step 2

create a directory called .venv which contains all
the tools for virtual environment.
** python3 -m venv .venv **

## Step 3

Activating the virtual environment created

whereas activate is small letters
 ** env\Scripts\activate **
